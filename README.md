# my_first_game
My first course didn't end with a simple project; it ended with a real game release. I didn't just submit a project â€“ I launched my own game.

I did everything myself. I created the unique design in Photoshop and then programmed everything in Flutter/Dart using VS Code. For one semester, this was my personal startup. I was the designer, the developer, and the game designer all at the same time.

Also, besides creating the game, I made all the official documents for it according to the GOST standards. These documents included:

Technical Specification

Application Description

Program Description

Explanatory Note

Test Program

User Manual

Programmer's Manual

System Programmer's Manual

So, by the end of my first year, I learned great skills: how to prepare and write official documents according to GOST and how to create my own mobile application. You can install this app using the link from me.
